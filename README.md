# PCAP-based-bot
A bot i built in college which actively reads from a PCAP file while wireshark dumps into it.

The bot will look for specific events to trigger off of based on what logs it recieves.

When the bot comes across a trigger, it will trigger an event that will either move the character, run from the fight, or wait til i can take control.
